# Binaural: Deep Focus, Redefined.

## ✨ You Do Not Need to Try Harder. You Need to **Think Clearer.**

For decades, the promise of productivity has been complex software, busy dashboards, and endless notifications. We've spent our lives searching for focus, only to find distraction.

Today, we change that.

**Binaural** is not a feature list; it is a **state of mind**. It is the simplest interface imaginable for the most powerful brain technology on the planet: **your own.**

We have taken decades of neurological research and distilled it into a single, seamless experience. Just open the app, choose your intent, put on your headphones, and **let your focus simply happen.**

## 🔬 The Science. The Soul.

Binaural is engineered around the principle of **Brainwave Entrainment**—the natural ability of your brain to synchronize its electrical activity to an external rhythmic stimulus. This is how we move your mind, on demand, into specific, high-performance states.

We selected four core presets based on the most robust and compelling research into human consciousness.

| Preset | Target State | Beat Frequency | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deep Focus** | **Beta** | **18 Hz** | Analytical thinking, high-level cognition, and sustained concentration. |
| **Meditation** | **Alpha** | **10 Hz** | Relaxed wakefulness, non-drowsy calmness, and creative flow. |
| **Deep Sleep** | **Delta** | **3 Hz** | Restorative, dreamless sleep, and deep bodily healing. |
| **Gamma** | **Gamma** | **40 Hz** | Peak concentration, information recall, and flashes of insight. |

### Why We Chose 18 Hz for Deep Focus

Our standard Deep Focus mode uses a binaural beat of **18 Hz** (Beta band, which is typically 12 Hz to 30 Hz) on a steady **200 Hz** carrier tone. We didn't choose 18 Hz because it's convenient—we chose it because **it works.**

Multiple studies indicate that exposure to frequencies in the Beta range can improve attention and task performance. We selected 18 Hz as the high-impact center of this range:

> The Beta frequency range is associated with **alertness, concentration, and problem-solving**. By nudging the brain toward this faster frequency, Binaural creates an optimal environment for sustained mental clarity during intense work sessions.

**Further Reading on Entrainment and Cognition:**
For those who want to see the research, the principle is confirmed in studies that look at how binaural beats can modify brain electrical activity.

* *Study Example:* Research published in the **Journal of Neurophysiology** and related journals often investigates the effect of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs), which are similar to binaural beats, showing cortical activity alignment to the beat frequency.

## 🎨 Design is How it Works

**Binaural** is powered by the **Web Audio API**. This is not a recording; it is **live sonic mathematics**.

The user interface is stripped of all complexity:

* **The Orb:** The subtle, pulsing visual orb is not just beautiful—it is a live visualization of the beat frequency, giving you a quiet, tactile feedback of your shifting brain state.
* **The Single Button:** Play and Pause. That’s it.
* **Custom Control:** If you need to fine-tune the parameters, the Custom mode reveals only the essential sliders—Base Tone and Beat Frequency—allowing you to become your own neuroscientist.

**We believe that the highest form of technology is that which disappears.** With Binaural, the technology fades into the background, leaving only you and your focused work.

## 🎧 Get Started

1.  Put on **stereo headphones**. (The two different frequencies *must* be delivered to the corresponding ear).
2.  Select your desired state: **Deep Focus** is the default.
3.  Hit **Play**.

**The future of focus is here. And it’s wonderfully simple.**
